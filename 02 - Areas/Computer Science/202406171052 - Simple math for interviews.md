### Permutations

n is the total number of items
r is the number of items to arrange
$$
{n\mathrm{P}_{r}} = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
$$


#### Combinations


$$
{n\mathrm{C}_{r}} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
$$

Where:
- `n` is the total number of items
- `r` is the number of items you want to choose
- `!` denotes factorial (the product of all positive integers up to that number)
