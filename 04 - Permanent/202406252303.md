### Tell me about yourself

I am Ashwin Sarith, Computer Science. I Graduated in 2023 and got my first job at FDM Group as a Software Development Consultant. I was trained at FDM to build Spring boot technologies, as well as build software solutions for inhouse projects during my time there. I built a basic transaction record system, that had extensive UI and backend logic to manage transactions. I additionally spent time working on combining react framework with spring to design a reactive website, as it follows a strong separation of concerns. As a consultant I was able to understand and quickly pick up each framework based on the requirements of the project. 


### Java

Some questions they can ask

**Pass By Reference vs Pass By Value in Java:**

In Java, primitives are passed by value, while objects are passed by reference.

* Primitives (int, double, boolean, etc.): When you pass a primitive as an argument to a method, a copy of the original value is created and passed to the method. Any changes made to the primitive inside the method will not affect the original variable.
* Objects: When you pass an object as an argument to a method, a reference to the original object is passed. Both the original object and the copy in the method refer to the same memory location. If you modify the object inside the method, the changes will be reflected in the original variable.

Here's some sample code to illustrate this:
```java
public class PassByReferenceDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 5;
        changePrimitive(x);
        System.out.println("x: " + x); // still 5

        String str = "Hello";
        changeObject(str);
        System.out.println("str: " + str); // now "Goodbye"
    }

    public static void changePrimitive(int y) {
        y = 10;
    }

    public static void changeObject(String s) {
        s = "Goodbye";
    }
}
```
In this example, the `changePrimitive` method receives a copy of the original value of `x`, so changing it inside the method doesn't affect the original variable. On the other hand, the `changeObject` method receives a reference to the original object `str`, and modifying it inside the method affects the original variable.

**Encapsulation:**

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It's about hiding the implementation details of an object from the outside world and only exposing its necessary features through public interfaces. This helps to:

1. **Hide internal state**: An object's internal state is not accessible from outside, which prevents external code from modifying it accidentally or maliciously.
2. **Control access**: Public methods provide controlled access to an object's internal state, allowing you to manage how and when the state is modified.

In Java, encapsulation is achieved by:

1. Using private fields (instance variables) to store an object's internal state.
2. Providing public getter and setter methods to access and modify the private fields.
3. Hiding implementation details inside the object, making it harder for external code to depend on those details.

Here's a simple example of encapsulation in Java:
```java
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```
In this example, the `BankAccount` object has a private `balance` field. The `deposit` method modifies the balance internally, and the `getBalance` method provides controlled access to the current balance.
